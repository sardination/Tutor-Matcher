# Simple Solutions Programming's Tutor Matcher
Simple Solutions Programming is our "company name" for the client project where we create an application that will help solve a problem for one of the teachers at our school. We created this Tutor Matcher for the teacher who runs the math honor society (Mu Alpha Theta).

To run, double-click on MuAlphaThetaTutorMatcher.jar. The application creates three files once run: tutorlist.csv, tuteelist.csv, and requests.csv. These serve as the data stores for this program.

The code is contained in the src folder.
